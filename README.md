## Objective: The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) capable of autonomous balancing and remote control. The UGV will utilize a smartphone gyroscope for balance sensing and Bluetooth for wireless communication. The Arduino Uno microcontroller will process the sensor data and control the motor driver to achieve precise movement and steering.
## Introduction : 
### This project aims to develop an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) capable of autonomous navigation and remote control. By utilizing a smartphone gyroscope for balance control and Bluetooth for wireless communication, the UGV can maneuver through various terrains. The Arduino Uno microcontroller processes the gyroscope data and controls the motor driver, enabling precise movement and steering.

## Problem Statement : 
### Traditional remote-controlled vehicles often require significant manual input for steering and balance. This project aims to address this limitation by developing an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) capable of autonomous balancing, allowing for more precise and efficient navigation.

### Components Used :
Hardware Components 

-- Armcon Side
- Gyroscope sensor of the Phone 
- Bluetooth Module of the Phone

-- UGV Side 
- Arduino UNO 
- Bluetooth Module 
- Motor Diver 
- 7.4 30 C Lithium-ion Battery 

Software Component Used- 
- Arduino IDE

## Working : 
1. Sensor Data Acquisition: The smartphone's gyroscope continuously measures the vehicle's angular velocity and acceleration. This data is transmitted to the Arduino Uno via Bluetooth.
2. Data Processing: The Arduino Uno receives the gyroscope data and processes it to determine the vehicle's orientation and any deviations from the desired balance.
3. Motor Control: the Arduino Uno sends control signals to the motor driver based on the processed data. In turn, the motor driver adjusts the motor's speed and direction to maintain balance and execute steering commands.
4. Remote Control: The Bluetooth module allows for remote control of the UGV. Users can send commands via a smartphone app or other Bluetooth-enabled devices to control the vehicle's movement and direction.

By combining these components and processes, the UGV achieves autonomous balance and responds to remote control inputs, enabling it to navigate various terrains and perform tasks. 

## Conclusion : 
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) capable of autonomous balancing and remote control. By utilizing a smartphone gyroscope, Arduino Uno microcontroller, and motor driver, the UGV achieves precise and stable movement. Future improvements may include integrating additional sensors like ultrasonic sensors or cameras for obstacle avoidance and advanced navigation capabilities.

### I invite further research to explore the limitations and potential enhancements of this system.
